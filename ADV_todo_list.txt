behaviour
	better hammer swinging; shouldn't loop, and remove first frame, probably.
	collision detection (add recoil behaviour and sprite frames?)
	update scrolling 
		instead of movement shown by background scrolling, have her travel across the screen, and then scroll background when she gets near the edge
	have platforms that she can jump on	
	running doesn't stop on landing

updated art assets(everything!)
	character design work for bad guys, etc.
	UI desgin work; not sure I'm feeling the example stuff
	sprite sheet
	splash screen
	background (be conscious of platform placement, etc.)
	
right now no sound is incorporated in the game, so this represents major work to be done

back end stuff, like high score keeping and other metrics to impress future employers

start thinking of code repository considerations (public/private, etc)

don't worry about actually web hosting until a long time from now
